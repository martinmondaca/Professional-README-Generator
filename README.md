  ## Description
  The motivation for this project was to use the npm inquirer package to create an application that takes user input and creates a README file. This way the user can better focus on working on their project.

  Working this project I was able to further my knowledge about the inquirer npm package and it's functionality including the editor and choices prompt.

  In the future I would like to be able to add additional questions to gain more information on the project. Also, the ability to opt of some questions that are not relevant to the project that the README is for.

  ## Installation
